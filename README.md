# Bonjouno-World
A greeting from me to the world.


Hay guys & girls. I'm new to the world of coding, after using W3 & codeacademy for a few weeks I have found this place. I really like the features here at Camp already this place is becoming my favourite place to learn.
I'm looking to eventually gain employment in webdevelopment, design and penetration testing.
Aside from teaching myself to code other things that hold my intrest are going to the gym, practicing Muay Thai and BJJ. 
Currently living in Birmingham (Uk) but shall be moving to Wales (the motherland) to live with my partner in a number of weeks.
Just saying hi and waving the flag. Hope to make some like minded friends along this path as we troll alomg :)
